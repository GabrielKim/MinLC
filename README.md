This Document for “MinLC(Minimalist Library Collections) Project”.

introduction
============

This project is a library that is divided into sections so that important parts of the system can be used easily and quickly.

In addition, this library is designed to be as small as possible and as simple to use as possible for all target machines (Intel, ARM, Etc.) and all operating systems (* nix, Windows, Etc.).

We will continue to add many things in the future, and we will do our best to continue to improve the ongoing issues and bugs.
